- 👋 Hello everypne! My name is Joel Hadley Jr. 
- 👀 I’m interested in being an SQL developer and I love using SQL to create databases, store data and query through databses.
- 🌱 I’m constantly studying SQL to make sure my skills never slip up, and because there's always something new to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find work as an SQL developer in the near future.
